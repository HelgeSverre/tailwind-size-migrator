A command-line tool that automatically migrates legacy Tailwind CSS height/width utility combinations to the new
`size-{n}` utility class where applicable.

## What it does

This tool scans your project files, finding instances where you've used `h-{n}` and `w-{n}` together
with the same value (where n is 1-12) and replaces them with the equivalent `size-{n}` utility class. Yes, this is
literally all it does.

For example:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<div class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-500">...</div>

<!-- After -->
<div class="size-6 text-gray-500">...</div>
```

## Features

- üîç Recursively scans directories for specified file extensions (like find+replace but more complicated)
- üö´ Configurable directory exclusion (because we learned from that one time we borked node_modules)
- ‚ú® Only updates files that need changes (revolutionary, I know)
- üìù Provides detailed console output of processed files (for when you need to know what you broke)
- üîí Safe processing with error handling (as safe as modifying files can be)
- üí° Maintains all other classes and file formatting (we're not monsters)
- üîÑ Dry run mode to preview changes (for the paranoid among us)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/helgesverre/tailwind-size-migrator.git
cd tailwind-size-migrator
```

## Usage

1. Navigate to your project directory
2. Back up your files (you're going to ignore this anyway)
3. Run the script with your desired options:

```bash
# Use defaults (current directory, .html and .blade.php files, vendor and node_modules folders are excluded)
python main.py

# Specify a different directory (default is current directory, which makes sense if you copy the script to your project)
python main.py -p ./src

# Specify custom extensions (for you non-Laravel folks, you know who you are)
python main.py -e .jsx .tsx .html

# Exclude specific directories (instead of the defaults vendor and node_modules)
python main.py -x build dist cache

# Specify path, extensions and exclusions (for the control freaks)
python main.py -p ./src -e .jsx .tsx -x build dist

# Do a dry run to see what would be changed without making changes
python main.py --dry-run

# Get help
python main.py --help
```

### Command Line Options

| `-p`, `--path`         | Directory path to search in (default: current directory)  |

| `-x`, `--exclude-dirs` | Directories to exclude (default: vendor node_modules)     |
